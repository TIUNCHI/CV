	<p>I am an assistant professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and a graduate field member in Computer Science, and Operations Research and Information Engineering at Cornell University. I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Theory of Computation Group at MIT, hosted by Piotr Indyk. I obtained my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UC San Diego, where I was advised by Alon Orlitsky. Before that, I got a Bachelors degree in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering from IIT Kharagpur.

    My research is supported by an NSF-CAREER award, an NSF-CRII award, an NSF-CIF small award, and a Google Faculty Research Award.</p>
